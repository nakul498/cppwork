multidimentional Arrays 
    1D array - contiguous collectoin of data 
        contiguous means without any gap
    2D array - contiguous collection of 1D array
    4073D array- it is an array where each element is 4072D array
    
    3D:1D array of 2D Arrays
                    |            
                    it is 1D array of 1D Arrays
                           |
                           it is contiguous collection of data
how to define 
arr[size of first level i.e lenght of 3d array]   [sizr of 2nd level] [size of 3rd level]
