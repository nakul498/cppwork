pointer
    -consider pointer have different data type 
        like pointer of int type 
            Take pointer as int* p not int *p
            a=102, add=80
            b=80, add=160
            &a=80;
            a=102;
            *b=102;
            b=80;
            &b=160;
           
           ] int* b is like a signal compiler that b is a valid address in memory

           ] 
    - Void pointer can store addresss of any pointer wheaher  char or int.
    we need to know the type of pointer as then only right amount of memory is taken from the system
    like address is 1 byte but if its an int* it will read 4 bytes if its some x object it may read 200 bytes in memory
    before using the ponter we have to cast it
    eg void *a=100; 
    *[(int *)a]
    -pointer arthmetic
        int arr[5]={1,3,4,2,5}
        if &a[o]=x
        &a[0]+1=x+4
        -&a+1 here if a is int then that 1 will give 4 bytes if its short it wil give 2 bytes
        in hexadecimal 
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,1A,1B,1C,1D,1E,1F,20
